# Let me google that for you

This was originally a recreation of the google homepage using basic HTML and CSS made for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Web Development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) course, but then I decided to warp it into a lmgtfy helper.

## How to use

Visit https://radiantly.github.io/lmgtfy and type the text you're googling for your friend. Click *Copy Link* and send the link over :)
